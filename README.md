# SafeFoodie
SafeFoodie is an application that will assist the user with grocery shopping, expiration date notification, store location, and food preservation. Although there are applications that offer similar tools, they tend not to include preservation methods that can increase the shelf life of food. From someone with experience managing a food pantry, I have seen just how much good food gets thrown away. With this application, not only will people be able to easily keep track of their perishable items, but they will learn how to keep them fresh for longer and where they can purchase their groceries.
